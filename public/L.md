### General

- deploying strapi to railway
- ssg ssr for ecom
- gsp - revalidate blocking vs false
- qs - instead of typing the url params we can simply pass the object.
- making a nice useFetch hook using useMemo and useEffect , params object, axios config ..
- always have a dedicated field for the slug.
- fully typeSafe context api.
- silly mistake of placing the provider below the layout in HOC tree in app js file
- in BE , don't forget to start psql service while running strapi develop
- sometimes localhost:1337 doesn't work then use 'http://127.0.0.1:1337'
- be careful testing - whether you end up testing on prod instead of localhost.
